# Oracle Mobile Wireless Application (MWA) GUI Client for Windows

Since Oracle EBS 11.5, Oracle provides a light-weight client-cerver network protocol to perform varies supply chain operations.  It can be done simply by any Telent client (which should be avilable in many handheld devices), or a simple Java client,  which needs the simplist Java 1.1 JRE to run.

After so many years (10+), Oracle EBS upgraded from 11.5, 12.1, and 12.2. This MWA client is still working fine, even though Oracle suggests that we should use the Apple of Android alternative - Oracle Mobile Supply Chain for EBS, and more recently it becomes Oracle Mobile SCM for EBS.
